Lets you define the spawn-rate of plants in all biomes.
Similar to the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564042934]Choose Wild Animal Spawns but for plants.

Added a slider for the overall plant density per biome.
You can also copy values between biomes

If you need higher accuracy than what the sliders provide, try adding the  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218078784]BetterSliders mod

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
