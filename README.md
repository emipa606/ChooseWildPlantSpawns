Lets you define the spawn-rate of plants in all biomes.
Similar to the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564042934]Choose Wild Animal Spawns but for plants.

If you need higher accuracy than what the sliders provide, try adding the  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218078784]BetterSliders mod
