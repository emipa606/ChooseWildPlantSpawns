Lets you define the spawn-rate of plants in all biomes.
Similar to the [Choose Wild Animal Spawns](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2564042934) but for plants.

Added a slider for the overall plant density per biome.
You can also copy values between biomes

If you need higher accuracy than what the sliders provide, try adding the [BetterSliders]( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218078784) mod
